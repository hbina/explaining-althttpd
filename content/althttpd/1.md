# Disclaimer

I am not knowledgeable in this.
Some of the information in these articles might be outright false.
Don't trust anything I say.
I just thought it might be interesting to document how I would go through this codebase.
Might be useful to new programmers to learn the tools of the trade (which I am learning how to use too!).

# Introduction

Its nice to have the codebase open as reference.
Each chapters will cover at most 1 function and I wouldn't go through every single bit.
Just the parts that I find interesting.
I will cover the global variables as we go through.

Sometimes there will be backtracking and jumping ahead of the source code as I see necessary.

Please read about the design philosophy [here](https://sqlite.org/althttpd/doc/trunk/althttpd.md).

Check out the source code [here](./../althttpd.c).
