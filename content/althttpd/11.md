This function replaces newline (`\n` or `\r`) with `\0`.

```c
/*
** Break a line at the first \n or \r character seen.
*/
static void RemoveNewline(char *z){
  if( z==0 ) return;
  while( *z && *z!='\n' && *z!='\r' ){ z++; }
  *z = 0;
}
```

This is probably done so that C-string appears as if it ends there.
But this is highly problematic because it does not return the `z`.
The caller have no way of knowing where that `\0` was assigned.
Even if they loop through again and find that `\0`, how do they know that this is the one that we assigned or this is actually the end of the string?

We have pretty much leaked the rest of the string.
