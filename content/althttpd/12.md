This function converts a `time_t` into its RFC822 representation.

```c
/* Render seconds since 1970 as an RFC822 date string.  Return
** a pointer to that string in a static buffer.
*/
static char *Rfc822Date(time_t t){
  struct tm *tm;
  static char zDate[100];
  tm = gmtime(&t);
  strftime(zDate, sizeof(zDate), "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z", tm);
  return zDate;
}
```

The interesting (in a bad way) is that it returns a pointer to a statically allocated memory.
So any time you make 2 calls to this bad boy, just remember that the first pointer returned is now invalid :).

One way to solve this is to make the caller of this function provides the bytes to write to.
This makes this function free from being responsible for memory; which it shouldn't.

# Testing

Let's try to use this function and see what we get.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

static char *Rfc822Date(time_t t)
{
    struct tm *tm;
    static char zDate[100];
    tm = gmtime(&t);
    strftime(zDate, sizeof(zDate), "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z", tm);
    return zDate;
}

int main(void)
{
    time_t t = time(NULL);
    char *zDate = Rfc822Date(t);
    const int r = printf("%s\r\n", zDate);
    return r < 0 ? -1 : 0;
}
```

Compiling and running this small program yields,

```bash
