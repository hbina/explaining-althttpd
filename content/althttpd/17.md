This is just a generic "404 NOT FOUND" template.
The only 2 values that it need to complete the document is:

1. `lineno` which depends on the caller of this function.
As I said in previous entries, I think every compiler have a C macro  for this already.
2. `zScript` which is the document that the user is attempting to retrieve.
This is probably the string after the domain in the URL.

```c
/*
** Tell the client that there is no such document
*/
static void NotFound(int lineno){
  StartResponse("404 Not Found");
  nOut += printf(
    "Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n"
    "\r\n"
    "<head><title lineno=\"%d\">Not Found</title></head>\n"
    "<body><h1>Document Not Found</h1>\n"
    "The document %s is not available on this server\n"
    "</body>\n", lineno, zScript);
  MakeLogEntry(0, lineno);
  exit(0);
}
```

Note that before ending the process, it will create a log entry.
