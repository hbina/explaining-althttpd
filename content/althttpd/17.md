This is just a generic "404 NOT FOUND" template.
The only 2 values that it need to complete the document is:

1. `lineno` which depends on the caller of this function.
As I said in previous entries, I think every compiler have a C macro  for this already.
2. `zScript` which is the document that the user is attempting to retrieve.
This is probably the string after the domain in the URL.

```c
/*
** Tell the client that there is no such document
*/
static void NotFound(int lineno){
  StartResponse("404 Not Found");
  nOut += printf(
    "Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n"
    "\r\n"
    "<head><title lineno=\"%d\">Not Found</title></head>\n"
    "<body><h1>Document Not Found</h1>\n"
    "The document %s is not available on this server\n"
    "</body>\n", lineno, zScript);
  MakeLogEntry(0, lineno);
  exit(0);
}
```

Note that before ending the process, it will create a log entry.
It's used in quite a few places,

```bash
hbina.github.io on  master [!?] 
❯ cat static/althttpd/althttpd.c | rg --line-number 'NotFound'
699:static void NotFound(int lineno){
917:    NotFound(150);  /* LOG: Cannot open -auth file */
943:        NotFound(160);  /* LOG:  http request on https-only page */
958:      NotFound(180);  /* LOG:  malformed entry in -auth file */
1327:  if( in==0 ) NotFound(480); /* LOG: fopen() failed for static content */
1687:  if( zScript[0]!='/' ) NotFound(210); /* LOG: Empty request URI */
1860:        NotFound(260);  /* LOG: Disallowed referrer */
1962:      NotFound(300); /* LOG: Path element begins with "." or "-" */
1974:    NotFound(310); /* LOG: URI does not start with "/" */

1982:    NotFound(340);  /* LOG: HOST parameter too long */
2007:        NotFound(350);  /* LOG: *.website permissions */
2049:      if( stillSearching ) NotFound(380); /* LOG: URI not found */
2054:        NotFound(390);  /* LOG: File not readable */
2071:        NotFound(400); /* LOG: URI is a directory w/o index.html */
2211:    NotFound(460); /* LOG: Excess URI content past static file name */
```
