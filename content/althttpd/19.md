title = "NotAuthorized"

Yet another HTTP response template.
This time its to indicate that the request is unauthorised to access that resource.

```c
/*
** Tell the client that authorization is required to access the
** document.
*/
static void NotAuthorized(const char *zRealm){
  StartResponse("401 Authorization Required");
  nOut += printf(
    "WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"%s\"\r\n"
    "Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n"
    "\r\n"
    "<head><title>Not Authorized</title></head>\n"
    "<body><h1>401 Not Authorized</h1>\n"
    "A login and password are required for this document\n"
    "</body>\n", zRealm);
  MakeLogEntry(0, 110);  /* LOG: Not authorized */
}
```

There's nothing much to be said about this function.
So let's take a look at its usage.
There's only 1 of them.

```bash
hbina.github.io on  master [?] 
❯ cat ./static/althttpd/althttpd.c | rg --line-number 'NotAuthorized'
731:static void NotAuthorized(const char *zRealm){
964:  NotAuthorized(zRealm);
```

## Configuring Authorization

The function that made the call is `CheckBasicAuthorization`.
This function parses an authorization file that may or may not exist in the directory that the resources is in.
One of the parameters that can be added in this configuration file is `realm`.
The documentation says,

```c
**    *  "realm TEXT" sets the realm to TEXT.
```

So while parsing this configuration file, we assign the "`TEXT`" above to `zRealm` here,

```c
    if( strcmp(zFieldName, "realm")==0 ){
      zRealm = StrDup(zVal);
```

But `zRealm` is never used!

```bash
hbina.github.io on  master [?] 
❯ cat ./static/althttpd/althttpd.c | rg --line-number 'zRealm'
731:static void NotAuthorized(const char *zRealm){
740:    "</body>\n", zRealm);
910:  char *zRealm = "unknown realm";
930:      zRealm = StrDup(zVal);
964:  NotAuthorized(zRealm);
```

So I assume its just a way for the author to determine what kind of files were being requested.

According to the actual [HTTP/1.0 specification for authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945#section-11), we can see that realms are basically used to tell the requester that the same realm should require the same kind of authentication.
Probably for caching purposes?

So it kinda makes sense that this value is not being used anywhere.
It's more like a guideline, not a strict spec.
It depends entirely if the resources are properly configured.
