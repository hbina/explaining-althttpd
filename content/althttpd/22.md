Just another HTTP response template for CGI errors.

```c
/*
** Tell the client that there is an error in the script.
*/
static void CgiScriptWritable(void){
  StartResponse("500 CGI Configuration Error");
  nOut += printf(
    "Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\n"
    "\r\n"
    "The CGI program %s is writable by users other than its owner.\n",
    zRealScript);
  MakeLogEntry(0, 140);  /* LOG: CGI script is writable */
  exit(0);
}
```

As the function name implies, it's being used whenever a script is writable by group and other have write permission to the file.
See "The file type and mode" section in the inode manual below.
