This function is pretty much self explanatory.
It is what is...
I guess I can start reading about the time utility in libc.

```c
/*
** Convert a struct timeval into an integer number of microseconds
*/
static long long int tvms(struct timeval *p){
  return ((long long int)p->tv_sec)*1000000 + (long long int)p->tv_usec;
}
```
