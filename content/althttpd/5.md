This function is a wrapper for malloc where it will exit the process if it fails.
I think the function itself is self-explanatory.
Nothing really interesting is happening here.

```c
/*
** Allocate memory safely
*/
static char *SafeMalloc( size_t size ){
  char *p;

  p = (char*)malloc(size);
  if( p==0 ){
    strcpy(zReplyStatus, "998");
    MakeLogEntry(1,100);  /* LOG: Malloc() failed */
    exit(1);
  }
  return p;
}
```
