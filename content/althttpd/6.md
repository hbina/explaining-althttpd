This function sets the environment variables.

```c
/*
** Set the value of environment variable zVar to zValue.
*/
static void SetEnv(const char *zVar, const char *zValue){
  char *z;
  size_t len;
  if( zValue==0 ) zValue="";
  /* Disable an attempted bashdoor attack */
  if( strncmp(zValue,"() {",4)==0 ) zValue = "";
  len = strlen(zVar) + strlen(zValue) + 2;
  z = SafeMalloc(len);
  sprintf(z,"%s=%s",zVar,zValue);
  putenv(z);
}
```

There's some issues with this function.

1. It does not free the memory held by `z`.
2. I think their implementation to prevent bashdoor attack is somewhat naive?
   I am pretty sure one can bypass this check by simply prepending whitespaces.
3. It does not check if `zVar` is a `NULL`.
   Granted, if you grep for its usage, you will find that it only uses statically allocated memory.

```bash
bash-3.2$ rg 'SetEnv' ./static/althttpd/althttpd.c
523:static void SetEnv(const char *zVar, const char *zValue){
2136:        SetEnv(cgienv[i].zEnvName,*cgienv[i].pzEnvValue);
```

The `cgienv` here is an array of CGI environment variables defined at the top of the file.
These are all statically allocated, so no problem here.
However, the performance could have been improved in this case by passing the length of the arrays into the function.
I am not sure if compilers are smart enough (or allowed to) optimized the call to `strlen` by evaluating the size at compile time.
