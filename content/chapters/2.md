This function accepts a C-string and returns another C-string with every double-quote doubled.

```c
/*
** Double any double-quote characters in a string.
*/
static char *Escape(char *z){
  size_t i, j;
  size_t n;
  char c;
  char *zOut;
  for(i=0; (c=z[i])!=0 && c!='"'; i++){}
  if( c==0 ) return z;
  n = 1;
  for(i++; (c=z[i])!=0; i++){ if( c=='"' ) n++; }
  zOut = malloc( i+n+1 );
  if( zOut==0 ) return "";
  for(i=j=0; (c=z[i])!=0; i++){
    zOut[j++] = c;
    if( c=='"' ) zOut[j++] = c;
  }
  zOut[j] = 0;
  return zOut;
}
```

First we have the variable declarations at the top of the function...
So its one of those code. _sigh_.
Second, we can see that there is 0 calls to `strlen`.
We perform a single pass on the original strings and a second one on the output string.
Pretty cool.

Notice that the caller of this function have no real way to know if allocations have been made.
However, from the design philosophy,

```
Because each althttpd process only needs to service a single connection, althttpd is single threaded.
Furthermore, each process only lives for the duration of a single connection, which means that althttpd does not need to worry too much about memory leaks.
These design factors help keep the althttpd source code simple, which facilitates security auditing and analysis.
```

So this seems like a conscious desicion.
If you grep for this function, its only being used in one place.

```bash
bash-3.2$ rg 'Escape' ./content/althttpd.c
387:static char *Escape(char *z){
481:        zDate, zRemoteAddr, zHttp, Escape(zHttpHost), Escape(zScript),
482:        Escape(zReferer), zReplyStatus, nIn, nOut,
488:        nRequest, Escape(zAgent), Escape(zRM),
```

Notice that they don't even assign the pointer returned by this function!
I will let you judge whether this is good idea or not.
