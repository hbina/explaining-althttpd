# Rough layout

1. Stare deeply at the reflection of yourself in a mirror. Stare deeply into the eye and try to appreciate that you are looking at "you".
2. The body is just a vessel.
   You are not your body.
   Consider what happens if you switch bodies, or transfer your consciousness to a robot. Are you still the same "person"?
   Let's remove the body because that is not "you".
3. The emotions (emotions, feelings, sensations) is just an experience.
   You are not your emotions.
   Consider what would happen if you lose the ability to smell.
   Are "you" gone? Is a part of "you" now gone?
   Let's remove the emotions because that is not "you".
4. The thoughts itself is also just an experience.
   You are not your thoughts.
   Consider what happens if you lose all of your memory and thus your personality, discover a new self and remembers your old self; which one are you? Are you the thoughts from your previous life or the new one?
   Let's remove the mind because that is not "you".
